# Advanced Data Structures Benchmark & Visualizer

A comprehensive implementation, benchmarking, testing, and visualization suite for classical Advanced Data Structures built from scratch in **C** and **JavaScript**.

## Overview

This project implements and evaluates five fundamental data structures:

* AVL Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Binary Heap
* Binomial Heap
* B+ Tree (T = 3)

The system combines:

* Efficient C implementations
* Empirical performance benchmarking
* Property-based testing
* Interactive visualizations
* Complexity comparison dashboard

The goal is to bridge theoretical analysis with real-world performance through reproducible experiments and educational visualizations.

## Benchmark Insights

* Binary Heap delivers the fastest insertion and minimum retrieval.
* B+ Tree performs strongly for balanced workloads and ordered access.
* AVL Tree offers strict balancing and predictable search performance.
* Red-Black Tree reduces balancing overhead compared to AVL.
* Binomial Heap excels at heap merge operations while trading off search efficiency.
